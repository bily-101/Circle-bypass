# Circle-bypass
Bypasses circle by changing mac address...
BUT! This script is special becuase circle will not know when the mac address is changed.
Becuase the script changes the mac address to an already known mac address on the network :)
Have fun with the unmonitored wifif

Sadly I have only tested it in Linux I am not sure if it works in windows yet.
I am working on that right now. Feel free to push updates. 

# Top 5 reasons to use this script
1. If you want to bypass circles system
2. If you want to Change your mac address secretly without an average sys admin noticing
3. If you are getting blocked by a firewall...(Only if the mac address you change to has internet access)
4. You just need to change your mac address
5. For fun?
